## Vision

### The vision of our product

To help prepare developers for the technical portion of job interview, and also to sharpen their problem solving skills.

### Pain points our project solves

* That programming and problem solving are skills that only come in practice.
* The technical interview process has become formulaic and unnatural for engineers, and we help them get ready for it.

## Why should people care about our product?

* There are more than 11 M programmers in the world and the number is increasing, we got a feedback that some programmers need more interactive learning websites that provide the ability to solve various problems to help them become more experienced in data structure and algorithms.

## Scope (In/Out)

### IN - What will our product do?

* Our website will give the user tha ability to find several programming problems that they can solve to be more prepared for programming world.
* The websites offers live code editor, starting with python, and number of languages will increase.
* The website will have a whiteboard so the users can draw their thoughts on, to get a better understanding of the problem.
* Users will have their own accounts so, they can save their previous attempts.

### OUT - What will our product not do

* Our product will not TBD.

## Minimum Viable Product vs stretch goals

### Our MVP

Our website will provide problems to solve on a live code editor, and a whiteboard.

* Set timer to see how much it took the user to solve the problem, or to give the user specific time to finish the task (the problem).
* Give the user the ability to add a contributor to the board while solving the problem.
* Give the user a tutorial when visits the website for the first time.
* Give the interviewer the ability to grade the problem solver on technical basis.

## Functional Requirements

* The admin can add or remove users from the website.
* The admin will add the problems to be solved.
* The user can create an account on the website.
* The user can type the code on the code editor and test it.
* The users can draw their thoughts on the whiteboard.
* The user will be able to access their previous attempts.

### Data Flow

The user will sign-up/sign-in on the website, then choose a problem to solve or review a previous attempt, type the code and test it, draw on the whiteboard, and the solution will be saved.
